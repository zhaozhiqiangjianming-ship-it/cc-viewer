- Feature: header displays country flag emoji based on network IP geolocation (via ipinfo.io); hover to see city, region, org, and IP; fallback to 🇨🇳 on request failure
- Feature: drag-and-drop file upload support
- Fix: full-chain real-time conversation refresh for main agent and teammates

## 1.6.11 (2026-03-20)

- Fix: full-chain real-time conversation refresh — teammate detection expanded to `--agent-name` (native team mode), metadata extraction no longer gated by `_isTeammate`
- Fix: teammate processes no longer trigger log rotation — only leader rotates
- Fix: `migrateConversationContext` truncates old file instead of deleting, preventing watcher `statSync` errors
- Fix: log-watcher truncation handler immediately checks `getLogFile()` for rotation and switches watcher
- Perf: `_reqScanCache` split into independent counters — `subAgentEntries` full-rescans on request changes without O(n²) on `tsToIndex`
- Perf: `appendToolResultMap` — hoist `split('\n')` out of loop to avoid O(L²)
- Perf: `isTeammate` WeakMap cache, `extractTeammateName` per-request cache

## 1.6.10 (2026-03-20)

- Feature: extract teammate name from SendMessage `tool_result` — `routing.sender` field provides reliable structured name, replacing fallback "X" display
- Fix: empty temp log files no longer renamed to permanent logs — empty files are deleted instead, preventing ghost sessions in file listing
- Fix: `migrateConversationContext` deletes empty old file after full migration instead of leaving 0-byte remnant
- Fix: server skips 0-byte log files in session listing API
- Fix: terminal cursor hidden to prevent stray blinking cursor in status bar area
- Fix: ChatView last response rendering cleanup
- Fix: AskQuestionForm — handle "Other" option from API natively, avoid duplicate "Other" entry; guard `questions` with `Array.isArray` check
- Fix: AskQuestionForm import path corrected to relative `../i18n`
- Fix: ptyChunkBuilder — remove extra Enter before typing text in "Other" input
- Fix: TerminalPanel cursor width restored to 1 for visibility
- Fix: resolveResumeChoice — always use new log path after rename
- Test: add teammate empty log filtering unit tests

## 1.6.8 (2026-03-19)

- Perf: `buildToolResultMap` — 4-pass full scan refactored to single-pass `appendToolResultMap` with WeakMap caching; historical sessions O(1), active session processes only new messages incrementally
- Perf: `buildAllItems` — 3 × O(n) full request scans merged into single incremental pass with instance-level cache (`tsToIndex`, `modelName`, `subAgentEntries`)
- Perf: `appendCacheLossMap` — cache loss analysis converted from full O(n) recompute to append-only incremental scan
- Perf: Last Response separated from `allItems` into independent state — main list updates are pure tail-appends, eliminating middle-insertion reflow during streaming
- Fix: SubAgent/Teammate requests not updating chat view when `mainAgentSessions` unchanged — added `requests` change detection in `componentDidUpdate`

## 1.6.6 (2026-03-19)

- Fix: guard null/undefined entries in `isRelevantRequest` — prevents `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'isHeartbeat')` crash during request filtering
- Fix: `selectedIndex` TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone) bug in `_flushPendingEntries` — variable was used before `let` declaration, causing `ReferenceError` when requests exceed 5000 cap, permanently freezing all state updates

## 1.6.0 (2026-03-18)

- Feature: Teammate display optimization — `Teammate: name(model)` format with dedicated team icon and per-name HSL color hashing
- Feature: AskQuestionForm extracted as standalone component — local state isolation eliminates parent re-render bottleneck during multi-select
- Feature: `ptyChunkBuilder.js` — pure functions for building PTY keystroke sequences (single/multi/other), separated from submission logic
- Feature: `writeToPtySequential()` server-side PTY write queue with per-chunk delay; `input-sequential` WebSocket message type
- Feature: multi-select PTY submission — → + Enter submit protocol, tab navigation for multi-question forms
- Feature: multi-question support — `_planSubmissionSteps()` annotates `isLast` flag; intermediate questions use → to switch tabs, last question uses → + Enter to submit
- Refactor: context window blood bar — cc-viewer no longer writes to `context-window.json`; reads `model.id` once at startup to cache 1M/200K size, computes usage from interceptor log
- Fix: Opus 4.6 1M context window detection — `readModelContextSize()` parses `[1m]` from `model.id`, `getContextSizeForModel()` maps API model names via cached base name
- Fix: `serverCachedContent` leak — `loadLocalLogFile()` clears stale server cache on local log switch
- Fix: removed `watchContextWindow` file polling — eliminates cross-process data pollution from teammates/other projects
- Docs: updated KVCacheContent concept docs across all 17 language versions

## 1.5.45 (2026-03-17)

- Fix: KV-Cache user prompt navigation — added SVG marching-ants dashed border animation on highlighted cache blocks (matching ChatMessage style)
- Fix: highlight timing — detect actual scroll completion via `scrollend` event + 500ms minimum delay, so animation appears after scroll settles instead of during
- Feature: raw mode cross-navigation — clicking user prompt nav in header popover now selects the MainAgent request, switches to KV-Cache-Text tab, and scrolls to the message with animation in DetailPanel
- Fix: DetailPanel performance — added `componentWillUnmount` timer cleanup, limited highlight state re-renders to kv-cache-text tab only, clear timers on request switch
- i18n: added `ui.userPromptNav` entries for all 18 supported languages, changed `ui.tokens` zh/zh-TW from "令牌" to "Token"

## 1.5.43 (2026-03-17)

- Fix: AskUserQuestion multi-question submit — replaced stale React state closure check with synchronous instance variable (`_currentPtyPrompt`) for reliable prompt detection across sequential question submissions

## 1.5.42 (2026-03-17)

- Feature: ultrathink button in PC terminal toolbar — writes `ultrathink ` command into terminal input without auto-submitting
- i18n: added `ui.terminal.ultrathink` entries for all 18 supported languages

## 1.5.41 (2026-03-17)

- Fix: AskUserQuestion single-select radio now clickable — replaced antd Radio.Group with custom div-based radio implementation
- Fix: AskUserQuestion interactive card renders in streaming "Last Response" — passes askAnswerMap, lastPendingAskId, onAskQuestionSubmit props
- Fix: CLI pre-answer detection — componentDidUpdate watches askAnswerMap changes to auto-replace interactive card with static answered card
- Fix: submit works without ptyPrompt — falls back to assuming first option selected (CLI default) when terminal prompt not detected
- Fix: mobile AskUserQuestion interactive — lazy WebSocket connect on submit, uses onAskQuestionSubmit gate instead of cliMode

## 1.5.40 (2026-03-16)

- Feature: log preview Popover — hover (desktop) or click (mobile) to see all user prompts in a floating panel
- Feature: mobile log table — timestamp hides year, shows `MM-DD HH:mm:ss` format
- Fix: preview column text overflow — maxWidth 600px with ellipsis for long prompts
- Fix: stats-worker prompt extraction rewritten to align with App.jsx/contentFilter.js logic (isSystemText, stripSystemTags, extractUserTexts)
- Fix: preview dedup — file-level Set dedup removes duplicate prompt text within same log file
- Fix: stats-worker STATS_VERSION 6→8, forces cache invalidation for re-parsing

## 1.5.39 (2026-03-16)

- Feature: AskUserQuestion interactive UI — pending questions render Radio/Checkbox controls with submit button in chat panel (single-select, multi-select, Other with text input, markdown preview layout)
- Fix: statusLine non-exclusive — no longer modifies user's `statusLine` in settings.json; context window data is now extracted from API response usage in the interceptor
- Fix: ExitPlanMode approval buttons now render immediately without waiting for PTY prompt detection; uses built-in default options as fallback
- i18n: added askSubmit, askSubmitting, askOther, askOtherPlaceholder entries for all 18 supported languages

- i18n: added plan approval and refresh stats entries for all supported languages

## 1.5.34 (2026-03-15)

- Fix: chat panel repeatedly refreshing after restart — `watchLogFile()` now initializes `lastSize` to current file size instead of 0, preventing duplicate broadcast of historical entries already sent via `/events` load flow

## 1.5.32 (2026-03-14)

- Refactor: move proxy-errors.js and proxy-env.js into lib/ directory
- Fix: skip redundant interceptor setup when CCV_PROXY_MODE is set (prevents duplicate fetch patching in Claude subprocess)
