When adding new interactive controls, remember to add corresponding i18n entries.
After completing any code changes, automatically run `npm run build` to rebuild the project.
When committing code to GitHub, always run `npm run test` first to ensure all tests pass. For new server-side scripts (*.js files in root or lib/), add corresponding unit tests in the test/ directory.
When committing code to GitHub, update history.md accordingly, and update README.md with translation into all i18n supported language versions if needed.
Before publishing to npm, check if any new root-level .js files are missing from package.json files array.
When adding node_modules dependencies, be sure to distinguish between devDependencies and dependencies.
